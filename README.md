# Real-time Chat Application

Its a web app created with node.js providing users a real-time chat interface with option to create or join separate rooms.

The application uses socket.io for creating event based websocket connection and is ready to deploy and was created as a part on tutorial while getting to know node a little better.

Application can be accessed at [this link](https://ashes-chat-app-node.herokuapp.com/ "this link") if I haven't scaled dynos to 0 or the app didn't went idle and got shut down by heroku.
